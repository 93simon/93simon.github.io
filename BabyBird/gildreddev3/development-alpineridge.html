                    <p>Located just east of the Ocotillo Wells area of Borrego Valley in eastern San Diego County, Ocotillo Wells Solar consists of a 50 Mega Watt solar photovoltaic project  on 100% privately held land owned by the Gildred Companies. The 440 acre site is fully permitted with the County of San Diego, the lead agency for the project.</p>

                    <p>This area of the desert is well recognized as having some of the highest rated insolation areas in the country, and the site’s current location benefits from that feature. The gentle-sloping grade of less than 3%, the utility-owned interconnection line traversing the site, and the sparse native vegetation also render this site ideal for a well designed solar facility. Construction is expected to begin in late 2016 with a project commercial operation date of 2017.</p>

                    <p>The project benefits significantly from being situated in a state with the country’s most aggressive Renewable Portfolio Standards (“RPS”) targets which currently mandate that Investor Owned Utilities and Load Serving Entities must contract renewable generation at a level equivalent to 33% by 2020. Ocotillo Wells Solar is poised to help meet that state mandate.</p>
