                      <p>Philip Gildred Sr. was born in Rochester, New York.  One of nine children, his family relocated to Argentina and Chile where the children were educated and where Phil Sr. began a successful textile business.  Phil Sr. had a great love for South America and especially Chile (Philip Gildred Sr. and George Gildred have both held the post of Honorary Consul of the Republic of Chile in San Diego and George Gildred continues to hold the post to this day).</p>
                      <p>Philip Gildred Sr. began his return journey to the United States via steamship from Ecuador to San Francisco where he planned to establish business. While en route the ship stopped in San Diego. Once Philip saw the beautiful port and the Hotel del Coronado, he told the captain he was leaving the ship and the rest is history.  He is quoted as saying “Although I had traveled for many years, I made my first trip to the West Coast of the United States in 1927 – and stayed. I was amazed at the beauty, and visualized the enormous possibilities for the City of San Diego.”</p>
                      <p>He had seen what Buenos Aires, Santiago, Lima and Guayaquil had to offer with their thriving, multi-cultural populations and important ports. With this knowledge, he was compelled to help shape the City of San Diego. He was a visionary with an incredible dream for our city.  </p>
