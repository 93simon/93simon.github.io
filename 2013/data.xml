Featured Project
	Sixth Avenue Wine Seller (Seattle, Pacific Place)

A friend asked me to program her mom's wine store located on the 3rd floor of Pacific Place Mall in downtown Seattle.   As with any website I do, I was given a few screenshots to work with and I programmed this from scratch. Although the version I wanted never made it online (my version had a nice audio loop to keep you entertained) - I was still happy with the execution.  The site was meant to play out slowly, elegantly, and with class so i lengthened the animations and slowed down the transitions with a high FPS for the final site.
